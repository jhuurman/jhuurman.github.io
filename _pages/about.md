I am very interested in the mathematical aspects of theoretical physics, also known as mathematical physics. As for what mathematical physics really _is_, I find the description in Friedli's and Velenik's "Statistical Mechanics of Lattice Systems" rather apt: "There is no general consensus on what \[mathematical physics\] actually refers to. In rough terms, what it means for us is: the analysis of problems originating in physics, at the level of rigor associated to mathematics."

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
